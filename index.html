        <h2>Love</h2>
        <p>Ruby was born on February 6, 2003.  We brought her and her sister, Stella, home right around my 30th birthday at the end of March. I didn't grow up with dogs, but loving them came instantly and easily. </p>
        <p>I used to laugh and tell people that I loved Ruby and Stella more than my husband and three kids combined. The funny thing, is that it wasn't really a joke.</p>

        <h2>Frenemies</h2>
        <p>After Ruby's best friend and sister Stella passed away way too young in 2009, we welcomed Allie to our family.  Ruby tolerated Allie, but just barely.  This is Ruby giving her "stink-eye" face, while Allie is trying to love her.  </p>

        <h2>Privilege</h2>
        <p>Ruby got sick in 2013.  I brought Rosie, Mack, and Sadie to see Ruby's doctor becuase I didn't know how to tell them, that we would probably lose Ruby in the near future.  The doctor told the kids that they were fortunate to have a dog who taught them how to live and would soon teach them how to die.  My heart cracked in two.
        <p>The greatest privilege of my life so far, was caring for Ruby when she finally needed me. It was an honor to carefully bake her meals, carry her up and down stairs, dress her wounds, and take long car rides to the vet.</p>
        <p>The best part of my day during those 10 years, was ending it with my arms around her every night.  And her last day, was no different than the rest. It ended with my arms wrapped tightly around her when her final breath left her body. In that moment, I tried so hard, to give her back some of the comfort and love, she endlessly and unconditionally gave to me.</p>
